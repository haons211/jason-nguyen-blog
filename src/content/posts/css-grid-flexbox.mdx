# CSS Grid vs Flexbox: When to Use Each

Both CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful layout tools. Learn when to use each one effectively.

## CSS Grid

Grid is perfect for two-dimensional layouts:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 20px;
}
```

## Flexbox

Flexbox excels at one-dimensional layouts:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## When to Use Grid

- Complex two-dimensional layouts
- Card layouts
- Magazine-style layouts
- Overall page structure

## When to Use Flexbox

- Navigation bars
- Centering content
- Equal height columns
- Component-level layouts

## Combining Both

You can use Grid and Flexbox together:

```css
.page-layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "header header"
    "sidebar main"
    "footer footer";
}

.header {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

## Conclusion

Both Grid and Flexbox have their place in modern CSS. Understanding their strengths helps you choose the right tool.
