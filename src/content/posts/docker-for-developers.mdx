# Docker for Web Developers

Docker revolutionizes how we develop and deploy applications. Learn the essentials for web development.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into lightweight containers.

## Basic Dockerfile

Create a Dockerfile for your Node.js application:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Docker Compose

Use Docker Compose for multi-service applications:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
  
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=myapp
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
```

## Development Workflow

1. Build the image: `docker build -t myapp .`
2. Run the container: `docker run -p 3000:3000 myapp`
3. Use volumes for development: `docker run -v $(pwd):/app myapp`

## Best Practices

- Use multi-stage builds
- Minimize image size
- Use .dockerignore
- Don't run as root
- Use specific image tags

## Conclusion

Docker simplifies development environments and ensures consistency across different stages of deployment.
