# Web Performance Optimization Techniques

Performance is crucial for user experience and SEO. Here are key optimization techniques.

## Core Web Vitals

Focus on the three Core Web Vitals:
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: < 2.5s
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: < 100ms
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: < 0.1

## Image Optimization

Optimize images for better performance:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image';

function OptimizedImage() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/hero.jpg"
      alt="Hero image"
      width={800}
      height={600}
      priority
      placeholder="blur"
    />
  );
}
```

## Code Splitting

Split your code to reduce initial bundle size:

```javascript
// Dynamic imports
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

// Route-based splitting
const About = lazy(() => import('./pages/About'));
```

## Caching Strategies

Implement effective caching:
- Browser caching
- CDN caching
- Service worker caching
- API response caching

## Bundle Analysis

Analyze your bundle size:

```bash
npm run build
npx @next/bundle-analyzer
```

## Conclusion

Performance optimization is an ongoing process. Regular monitoring and optimization ensure the best user experience.
