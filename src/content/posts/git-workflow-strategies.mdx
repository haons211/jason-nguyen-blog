# Git Workflow Strategies for Teams

Choosing the right Git workflow is crucial for team productivity. Let's explore popular strategies.

## Git Flow

Traditional branching model with multiple branch types:

```bash
# Feature development
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
git commit -m "Add login functionality"
git checkout develop
git merge feature/user-authentication

# Release preparation
git checkout -b release/1.2.0
git checkout main
git merge release/1.2.0
git tag v1.2.0
```

## GitHub Flow

Simplified workflow with feature branches:

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b add-search-feature

# Make changes and commit
git commit -m "Implement search functionality"

# Push and create pull request
git push origin add-search-feature
```

## GitLab Flow

Environment-based branching:

```bash
# Development
git checkout -b feature/new-dashboard

# Staging
git checkout staging
git merge feature/new-dashboard

# Production
git checkout production
git merge staging
```

## Trunk-Based Development

Continuous integration with short-lived branches:

```bash
# Short-lived feature branch
git checkout -b quick-fix
git commit -m "Fix button alignment"
git checkout main
git merge quick-fix
git branch -d quick-fix
```

## Best Practices

1. **Commit Messages**: Use conventional commits
2. **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive names
3. **Pull Requests**: Always use code review
4. **Merge Strategy**: Choose squash, merge, or rebase consistently

## Conventional Commits

```bash
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve login button styling
docs: update API documentation
refactor: simplify user service
test: add unit tests for auth
```

## Conclusion

Choose a Git workflow that matches your team size, release cycle, and deployment strategy. Consistency is key!
