# React 19: New Features and Improvements

React 19 introduces several groundbreaking features that will change how we build React applications.

## Server Components

Server Components allow you to render components on the server, providing better performance and SEO.

```jsx
// Server Component
async function BlogPost({ id }) {
  const post = await fetchPost(id);
  return <article>{post.content}</article>;
}
```

## Actions

Actions provide a new way to handle form submissions and mutations.

```jsx
function ContactForm() {
  async function submitForm(formData) {
    'use server';
    // Handle form submission
  }

  return (
    <form action={submitForm}>
      <input name="email" type="email" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Performance Improvements

React 19 includes significant performance improvements:
- Faster reconciliation
- Better memory usage
- Improved hydration

## Conclusion

React 19 brings exciting new capabilities to the React ecosystem. These features will help developers build faster, more efficient applications.
